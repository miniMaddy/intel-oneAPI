## A Brief of the Prototype:

The proposed idea is to develop a medical image processing application using ChexNet and SYCL for parallel computing, to predict the presence of chest diseases in medical images and generate a heatmap for interpretation. The application aims to offer faster and more accurate medical image processing than existing applications.

Some of the features of the application are:
- Chest disease prediction: The application uses ChexNet, a deep learning model for chest x-ray image analysis, to accurately predict the presence of 14 different chest diseases from medical images.
- Faster processing times: The application is designed to take advantage of parallel computing using SYCL, which can potentially lead to faster processing times compared to existing medical imaging applications.
- Heatmap generation: The application generates a heatmap on the original medical image to aid in interpretation and make the results more actionable for healthcare professionals.
- User-friendly interface: The application can be designed with a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use, to make it accessible for healthcare professionals with varying levels of technical expertise.
